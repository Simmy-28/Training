<!-- "use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode". 
With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.
 It helps you to write cleaner code, like preventing you from using undeclared variables.
 Deleting a variable (or object)  or  function is not allowed
