<!--Method Reuse
    With the apply() method, you can write a method that can be used on different objects
    The apply() method is similar to the call() method
    The difference is:

The call() method takes arguments separately.

The apply() method takes arguments as an array.

The apply() method is very handy if you want to use an array instead of an argument list.
